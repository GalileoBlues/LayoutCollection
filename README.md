# LayoutCollection
A collection of my layouts ranging from finished to concepts


### Nitro S

Based on Nitro which was co-created by Oxey and based on a layout generated on Oxeylyzer, Nitro S is meant to be better in every way to Nitro.

```
p m l d x  v c o u , 
n t r h y  b s a e i 
z q j f k  w g ' ; .
```

### Nitrogen

Nitrogen is based on Nitro S and it's aim is to push as much usage to the top and home rows while also keeping the same philosophy of Sturdy by Oxey using the same vowel block and similar LM and LR columns. Nitrogen has high Alternation and comparatively low Rolls.

```
p m l c w  f d o u ,
n t r s g  y h a e i
z j q b v  x k ' ; .
```

### Hydrogen

Hydrogen is also based on Nitro S and was made at the same time as Nitrogen, Hydrogen differs in what index columns are used and was created with the intention of promoting more In-Rolls which results in more Redirects.

```
p m l d f  b c o u , 
n t r h y  g s a e i 
z v j k x  q w ' ; .
```

### Helium

Helium is a layout loosely based on Hydrogen and tries to create a new vowel arrangement that places 'U' above 'H' in the index column.

```
p l d c g  v u o y q
n r t s b  f h e i a
j x m w z  k . ' ; ,
```

### Gallium
Gallium is a heavily modded version of Helium with the target goal of hand balance and index inner column balance.

```
b l d c v  z y o u , 
n r t s g  f h a e i 
q x m w j  k p ' ; . 
```
### Ruthenium
```
w d l f x  q b u o y
r t h s g  . n e a i
j k m c v  z p ' , ;
```

### Ruthenium NL

Ruthenium NL is a mod of the original made by Stronglytyped and Bryson with the goal of making a layout with HL since it's very low SFBs in a column with L.

this mod switches out N and H allowing H to be on vowel hand index lowering Redirects and allows for Y to be on the index rather than above I.

```
w d l c x  q f o u , 
r t n s b  y h a e i 
z k m g v  j p ' ; .
```

### Thallium

Thallium is a layout based on Semimak made in mind with the concept of "consonant blocks" inspired by the way that this vowel block has diagonal rolls like `au` and `eo` the idea was to recreate this with consonants such as `th` and `dn` but space them out between fingers.

```
f d l h v  z w u o y 
s t r n m  p c e a i 
x k ' b q  j g , . /
```

### Argon
```
f r l c b  , k u o y
s n h d g  j t e a i
q x m p w  z v ' . ;
```
